            To use the site, select the best description of each skill below.
            Recommendations for assessment tools to measure each skill are in
            each skill box below as well. Note that language proficiency means
            oral language proficiency and/or vocabulary, depending on assessment
            scores available. After you click submit, a recommendation of the
            reading intervention priorities for the learner is provided. To use
            the site for another recommendation, simply click ‘clear’ and select
            other skill descriptions.

            Where did these recommendations come from?
          </h6>
          <div class="card-text d-flex">
            The skill descriptions are based on the Instructional Hierarchy, a
            framework for describing student skills, and commonly used language
            proficiency designations (Beginning, Intermediate, and Advanced can
            map roughly onto WIDA language proficiency levels). The
            recommendations are based on research about biliteracy, reading
            theory, reading interventions for bilingual learners, as well as
            best practices in intervention with English language learners. We
            will link some accessible research that isn’t behind paywalls below.
            Our recommendations are iterative; as we learn more from research
            and implementation we will update them. The site will be dated so
            you will always know how recently the recommendations have been
            updated.

            Why is there a reading intervention recommendation and a phonemic
            awareness recommendation? Isn’t phonemic awareness a reading skill?
          </h6>
          <div class="card-text d-flex">
            We have noticed that some students, particularly students who might
            be at risk for specific learning disabilities in reading,
            demonstrate phonemic awareness weaknesses even after making progress
            in skills like decoding and reading connected text. Therefore, we
            suggest screening phonemic awareness if there are reading concerns,
            particularly for bilingual learners for whom intervention targeting
            is that much more complex.
